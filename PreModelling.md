> This section explores the SOA datasets and the relationship between a variety of variables. It also delves into the football players' relative statistics and attempts to deal with data irregularities. The corresponding Excel workbook can be downloaded [here](Pre-Modelling_and_Economic_Analysis.xlsx) and R file [here](insert R file here).
