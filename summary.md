# Welcome to the TKGJ Consulting Repository, which explores the journey undertaken to select the new, successful Raritan Football team.

### To ensure the best competitive Raritan Team, TKGJ Consulting established a unique methodology to select the 25 players in the new national club.

Extensive pre-modeling analysis allowed for preliminary insights and economic impact modeling assured the methodology employed assured financial success. An implementation plan is provided to ensure Rarita receives these benefits, including the choice of players for its national team. Finally, the repository concludes with risk management, ethical issues, and limitations.

### Overview of Unique Methodology Employed

Three metrics (Skill, Popularity and Wellbeing) were constructed to measure player performance. The aggregated three indices were then used to assign players an overall score and the highest ranked players were easily identified. However, other qualitative factors needed to be considered to provide a holistic approach to team selection. As such, judgement was employed finally. Listed below is an overview of the qualitiative factors considered.

There is an extensive range of ages within the team.


### Tournament Simulation

To quantify Rarita’s success, a tournament simulation was designed. Averages of the chosen Rarita team’s Skill, Popularity and Wellbeing metrics were calculated, alongside those for other countries. This permitted comparison and thus the calculation of the Raritan expected rank to be 8.2. 

Rarita’s performance, in terms of the Indices, compared to all other nations is displayed below. Whilst average in terms of Popularity and Wellbeing, the chosen team boasts extraordinary Skill Scores.
