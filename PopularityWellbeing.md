### Popularity Index

The second metric used, named the Popularity Index, evaluated how famous the player was on the world stage, which is crucial to increase awareness and thus revenue of the Rarita team. Appendix, 9.4. Popularity Index, lists all factors considered. Once relevant data was found and divided by player, everyone was ranked according to the separate factors. These ranks were then standardised by their mean and population standard deviation. Country data was assigned to players of that nation, e.g. Nganion players have equivalent social media scores. Finally, the average of all the standardised scores was taken, resulting in the final Popularity Index.

### Wellbeing Index

Wellbeing was the third key metric applied. Ensuring camaraderie amongst players is crucial when creating a positive team culture, as individuals can perform better when they genuinely enjoy themselves, trust others and are supported through their own personal and professional growth. The Wellbeing Index was designed to indicate the player’s likelihood of positively contributing to the team’s morale. Appendix, 9.5. Wellbeing Index, lists all factors considered. Similar methodology as the Popularity Index was then applied, in terms of rankings and standardisation.
