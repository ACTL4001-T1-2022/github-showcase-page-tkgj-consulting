Sensitivity analysis was performed by changing various assumptions in the [economic modelling spreadsheet](Pre-Modelling_and_Economic_Analysis.xlsx) by one percentage point and by one standard deviation and seeing the resulting impact on projected profit.

### Ethics
For the ethics section, each recommendation was considered according to how they would affect the main stakeholders. The first two in the table below were discussed in the report as they were in most need of justification.
