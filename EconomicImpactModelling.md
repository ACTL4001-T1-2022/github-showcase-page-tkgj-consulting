# Modelling of Economic Impact
---

> This section outlines how Rarita Football's revenues and expenses were forecasted through an analysis of economic trends and modelling of different types of revenue. The corresponding Excel workbook can be downloaded [here](Pre-Modelling_and_Economic_Analysis.xlsx).

### Economic and Population Trends
The limited years of economic data available for the regions of Rarita meant that medium-term sample means were taken to forecast the corresponding economic variables. It was assumed over the next 10 years that the economy would behave in line with these averages.

### Forecasting Revenue and Expenses Over the Next 10 Years
> Two processes of forecasting the cash flows were considered:
* A naive model which assumed per capital total revenue growth would follow some function of GDP per capita growth and that expenses would grow at its previous 5 year average.
* A comprehensive model that forecasted per capita commercial, matchday and broadcast revenue seperately and that expenses would grow at its previous 5 year average.
#### Naive Model
The naive model utilised simple linear regression with the dependent variable being per capital total revenue and the sole independent variable being GDP per capita. The justification for this was that as an economy grows, incomes will grow and will allow individuals to spend more money on leisure related goods, including those related to Raritan football. GDP growth was assumed to grow at a constant 3.94% per year as outlined aboved.
